# Movie Rating Classification with PySpark and Scikit-learn

This project aims to classify movie ratings into categories like `poor`, `average`, `good`, and `excellent` using PySpark and Random Forest.

# Tools Used
- PySpark for Big Data processing
- Pandas and Scikit-learn for ML
- Docker for container setup
- Jupyter Notebook

# Folder Structure
- `/data`: Input CSV data
- `/notebook`: All processing and ML steps in one notebook
- `/figures`: Plots like confusion matrix, feature importance
- `/report`: Final written report

# Model Accuracy
- Accuracy: 80.4%
- Best performance on predicting `poor` class (Precision: 0.98)

# How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Start Docker (`docker-compose up`)
3. Open Jupyter and run the notebook step by step
