Developing an End-to-End Big Data Pipeline Using Hadoop, Spark, and MLlib

# Movie Rating Classification with PySpark and Scikit-learn
Today, digital movie platforms often struggle to classify movies by quality. As a result, users may receive irrelevant or poorly-rated recommendations.
I found my dataset on Kaggle and chose it. Because it looked interesting and I might make a business insight with this data. It contained various movie related features like runtime, vote count, language, and ratings. 

This project aims to classify movie ratings into categories like `poor`, `average`, `good`, and `excellent` using PySpark and Random Forest.

# Tools Used
- PySpark for Big Data processing
- Pandas and Scikit-learn for ML
- Docker for container setup
- Jupyter Notebook

# Model Accuracy
- Accuracy: 80.4%
- Best performance on predicting `poor` class (Precision: 0.98)

# How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Start Docker (`docker-compose up`)
3. Open Jupyter and run the notebook step by step
